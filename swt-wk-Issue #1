**Title**: App doesn’t handle uppercase or mixed-case city names

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Open Weather Checker Lite
2. Type "LONDON" in all caps
3. Click "Check Weather"

**Expected**: Should show the weather for the city (e.g., for “nairobi ”, show “nairobi”, “24°C”, “Sunny ☀️”).
**Actual**: Shows "City not found" Try: nairobi, london, tokyo, new york, sydney.”
**Severity**: Medium

**Additional Notes**: Despite .trim(), extra spaces still break the exact match. Suggest adding .toLowerCase() after trim.
